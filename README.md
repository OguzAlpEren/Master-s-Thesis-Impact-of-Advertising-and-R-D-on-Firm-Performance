## Overview
This repository contains the research and findings from my Master’s thesis titled "Investing in Competitive Advantage: The Impact of Advertising and R&D Intensity on Firm Performance." The study explores how strategic investments in marketing and R&D influence firm performance, measured through market valuation and net income. Using data from the S&P 500, the research applies both fixed and random effects models to investigate nuanced effects.

## Key Topics

## Abstract
The thesis explores the relationship between firms' marketing and R&D investments and their impact on firm performance. Findings suggest that advertising and R&D investments can significantly influence market value (Tobin’s Q) but have varying effects on net income. This study provides a foundation for future research in strategic management, particularly in balancing value creation and value appropriation to sustain competitive advantage.
